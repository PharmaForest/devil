## Welcome to Developer's Ideas Library(DEVIL) ##
The package is a library of any ideas at any stages from anyone. PharmaForest will maintain the package obtaining ideas from developers. Contact PharmaForest members if you are interested. Purposes of adding devils(components of the package) can be like joking(for fun), trial, showing-off, or recruiting members for further development by showing POC for someone who don't have github account or not faimliar yet with SAS packages framework but is interested in sharing.

## `text2morse()` function <a name="text2morse-functions-1"></a> ######

text2morse is a function that converts text to Morse code.
options cmplib=work.f ; is required prior to f1 is used.

  
---
 
## `%chatdms()` macro <a name="chatdms-macros-2"></a> ######
This is macro to chat with LLMs(openAI / Google) in SAS DMS(Display Management System) for who cannot afford Viya Copilot. This is actually like Rshiny application which creates window for prompt and you can receive responses from LLMs in log window.
Parameters:
- provider: openAI or google
- model : please specify(e.g. gemini-1.5-flash, gpt-3.5-turbo)
- apikey : please input
- max_tokens : 512 (default)

## `%life_game()` macro <a name="lifegame-macros-3"></a> ######

Program     : %life_game
 Description : Simulates Conway's Game of Life in SAS and generates an animated GIF output.
               Uses a grid of cells initialized randomly or from an input dataset, applies 
               the life game rules iteratively, and visualizes the process as a heatmap animation.

 Author      : Yutaka Morioka
  License : MIT 

 Parameters  :
   outpath       - File path to save the output GIF.
   outfilename   - Name of the output GIF file (default: lifegame).
   seed          - Random seed for initial cell generation (default: 777).
   loop          - Number of iterations (animation frames) to simulate (default: 50).
   xwide         - Width of the grid (default: 50).
   ywide         - Height of the grid (default: 50).
   ds            - Optional input dataset to use as the initial grid. If not provided,
                   a random grid will be generated.

 Output      :
   Animated GIF file showing the evolution of the Game of Life simulation.

 Notes       :
 - The initial grid is either randomly generated or taken from the specified dataset.
 - Each cell's state is updated based on the standard rules of Conway's Game of Life.
 - The macro uses SAS hash objects to efficiently access neighbor cells.
 - The animation is rendered using PROC SGPLOT with heatmap visualization.

 Usage Example:
   %life_game(outpath=D:\Users\Example\Output, outfilename=mygame, loop=100, xwide=60, ywide=60);

## `%sudoku_solver()` macro <a name="sudokusolver-macros-4"></a> ######

Here is the explanation of %sudoku_solver.

### Sample code
puzzle=     : the Sudoku puzzle converted into a SAS dataset (Refer to the following 'prerequisites' section!)
outputpath= : the directory where the results are output (LOG file or RTF file when rtfYN=Y)
rtfYN=      : Default is N. If you change this parameter to Y, an RTF output will be created in 'outputpath'.
~~~sas
%sudoku_solver(
    puzzle=__sudoku__, 
    outputpath=/home/XXXXX/sudoku/, 
    rtfYN=Y
   )
~~~

### prerequisites
 <For input data> 
 Please convert the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve into a dataset as shown in the example below.
 (It must be SAS dataset with 9 numeric variables (c1-c9) and 9 observations.)
 Note: 
  - Fill the blank spaces in the puzzle with 0. 
  - Make sure to name the variables strictly as c1-c9, but the dataset name can be anything.
 
data sudoku1;
 input c1-c9 8.;

### Other
 - "Sudoku" is a registered trademark of Nikoli. (https://www.nikoli.co.jp/ja/puzzles/sudoku/)
 - The maximum number of backtracks is set to 50,000. 
 - This is because most Sudoku puzzles can be solved within 50,000 backtracks.
 - If there is a request to specify the number of backtracks in the macro parameter, I will consider it:)
